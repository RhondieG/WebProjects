    <h2>Hurricane Dorian has <em>destroyed</em> the Island of Bahamas</h2>

      <p>Hurricane Dorian made landfall on the Abaco Islands, then hitting the Bahamas on August 31, 2019. The Category 5 storm continued to churn northwestward, but hovered over the Bahams for a steady 36 hours, with little movement.
          The storm sustained winds of 185 mph. Gusts over 200 mph were being experienced there while the storm surged up to and over 20 feet. Dorian was second only to Hurricane Allen in 1980, with its 190mph winds.</p> 

    <h2> How do we help the Island that thrives on tourism and external resources?</h2>

<h3> Relief Efforts</h3>
      <p> While the death tole continues to rise in the Bahamas, there are things that we can do to help with the devastation on the Island.  The only international airport on the island of Grand Bahama was destroyed and cannot serve as a staging ground for medical evacuations or emergency aid deliveries, but we can send over resources in other ways.  Below, you will find a image that will lead you to helping with relief efforts.  Be sure to click on the image and be so kind to participate in the giving back.</p>
